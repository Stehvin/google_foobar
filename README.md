# Google Foobar Coding Challenge
While googling Python-related questions, I was invited to try out Foobar, a coding challenge made by Google.

The files in this repository are my solutions to the challenge. Unfortunately, I neglected to save my solutions from the first two 
levels, so I only have levels 3-5 saved here.

If you are currently taking the challenge, please don't look at my solutions. The point of a challenge is to test your skill and learn 
new things, and you won't do either by copying answers.

If you are not currently taking the challenge, please let me know what you think of my solutions! I'm open to hearing criticisms and 
learning about optimizations I may have missed.
